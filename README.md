# Machine-Learning

## Traditional Machine Learning
In this folder I have code that mostly deals with any type of machine learning that is not deep learning including but not limited to analysis of loss functions and kernel methods. 

## Deep Learning
This folder includes all the code that I have used for implementing neural nets including but not limited to recurrent & convolutional and localization/explability methods.
